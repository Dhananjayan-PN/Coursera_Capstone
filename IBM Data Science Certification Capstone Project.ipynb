New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square mile, New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.\n\nWith such a densely populated city, it is found that New York is filled with restaurants in almost all neighborhoods. In such a city, it is often difficult for someone to find the best place to open their own restaurant.\n\nIn this project, we will be leveraging the data provided to us by the vast internet, to help us find the best neighborhood for a restaurant-owner to open their restaurant, in order to get guaranteed business."
